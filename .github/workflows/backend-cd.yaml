# There should be a file called .github/workflows/frontend-cd.yaml in the root of the project 
# There should be a step in the workflow that runs linting. There should be a step in the workflow that runs the tests There should be a step that builds the application using docker.
# There should be a step that utilizes aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login action for logging into ECR. 
# (using 3rd party actions) The ECR login step should also be accessing Github Secrets for credentials. (secure approach)
# There should be a step that pushes the docker image to ECR in the AWS account. There should be a step that deploys the application using kubectl to the kubernetes cluster
